# LabJack-IO-Board
Working with a Labjack and breadboard often presents challenges, particularly when dealing with tangled wires and the time-consuming task of building circuits on the breadboard. To address these issues, I developed a simple board module to streamline this process. This module significantly reduces the hassle by allowing you to connect a wire directly from the Labjack port to the corresponding port on the board device.
## What Does it Do?
- This project is a simple board with I/O components such as pushbuttons, LEDs, and a buzzer that we can connect and use with LabJack to test its port functions. 
## Software Used
- Autodesk Fusion (for all electronics and 3D models)
